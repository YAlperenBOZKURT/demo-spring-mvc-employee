   git clone https://github.com/username/employee-management-spring-boot.git
   cd employee-management-spring-boot
   ```

2. Create a PostgreSQL database and configure the database connection settings in the `src/main/resources/application.properties` file.

3. Compile the project using Maven:

   ```shell
   mvn clean install
   ```

4. Start the application:

   ```shell
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

## Project Structure

The project follows the standard Spring Boot MVC structure:

- `src/main/java/com/username/employeemanagement/`:
    - `controller/`: Contains controller classes that handle HTTP requests.
    - `entity/`: Defines the employee entity class.
    - `dao/`: Includes the repository interface for database operations.
    - `service/`: Provides service classes for business logic.
- `src/main/resources/`:
    - `application.properties`: Configuration file for database and other properties.
    - `templates/`: HTML templates for web pages.

## Configuration

To configure your PostgreSQL (you can use any sql language ) database connection, update the `application.properties` file as follows:

```properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/your_database_name
spring.datasource.username=your_username
spring.datasource.password=your_password
```

## Usage

### Adding an Employee

To add a new employee, go to `http://localhost:8080/employees/showFormForAdd` in your web browser and fill out the employee details in the form.

### Listing Employees

To view a list of all employees, go to `http://localhost:8080/employees/list` in your web browser.

### Updating an Employee

To update an existing employee, go to `http://localhost:8080/employees/showFormForUpdate?employeeId={id}` (where `{id}` represents the employee's identifier). Make the necessary changes in the form and submit.

### Deleting an Employee
